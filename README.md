My Portfolio page displays a little information about my experience with Web Development, a few projects I've created, 
and a contact section displaying some relevant links as well as a built-in form to contact me directly through email.

Currently hosted through GitHub pages on https://ben-langlois.github.io/Portfolio/

Any comments, questions or suggestions can be sent to me by email at ben.langlois02@gmail.com or try out the contact form at the bottom of the webpage!
